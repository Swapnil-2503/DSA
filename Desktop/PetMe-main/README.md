## Inspiration for the Project:

It has been estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States each year. This happens for the reason that there are too many pets that are enrolled into shelters and only a few people consider adoption when they look out for a pet.

**The number of euthanized animals can be reduced drastically if more people adopt pets instead of buying them from stores. When you adopt an animal, you save a lovely life by making them a part of your family as well as open up a shelter space for an animal who might be in need of one desperately.**

When the team heard about the animals that were getting in danger each year, it became a goal for us to help these speechless beings somehow. After brainstorming for a long time we came up with the idea of **PetMe**. We believe in the policy of saving animals and thus saving lives. Every life matters and we wish to be the part of the change that is making the same possible.

- Users can use the `Contact` page to drop in their details for a call with one of the team members.

## Accomplishments:

We are proud to build a website where pet lovers can easily adopt animals that need a home. They can not only provide medical assistance to them but can also allow their comrades in the community to adopt them.

## What's next for PetMe üì≤

In future, we plan to scale this application to reach as many people as possible and facilitate adoption and donation of animals.

Furthermore, we plan to connect with the nearest government organization that provides medical assistance to stray animals.
